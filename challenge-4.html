        <P>Web development involves building and maintaining websites or web applications. It includes front-end development (what users see) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development (server-side logic) using languages like Python, PHP, or Node.js. Developers may also work with databases, APIs, and version control systems like Git. Web development ensures a site is functional, responsive, and user-friendly. It ranges from simple static pages to complex, dynamic web applications.
